## Data

data is collected from research station in Antarctica. There are two datasets. 

![Penguins](https://www.cabq.gov/artsculture/biopark/news/10-cool-facts-about-penguins/@@images/1a36b305-412d-405e-a38b-0947ce6709ba.jpeg)

## Single trait distribution


The penguins of Biscoe island show the most variable bill length. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm)) + facet_wrap("island")
```


## Relationship between multiple traits 

Body mass and flipper length has a positive relationship in penguins. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) 
```


## Sexual dimorphism 

Female penguins have shorter bills than male penguins. The greatest level of sexual dimorphism seems the largest in the Chinstrap species. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) + geom_boxplot(aes(x=sex, y=bill_length_mm)) +facet_wrap("species")

```
